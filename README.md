# Text Analysis Final Project
I decided to use the Presidential Inaugural Addresses corpora provided to us on Box. My project was to map out and provide a visualiztion for pronoun type density between the different Inaugural Addresses in order to provide a clear way to determine if there were any trends to be found.

With this in mind, I ordered the graph on a chronological order, and split up the pronoun catagorization into 5 distinct catagories. These catagories can be summarized as 'I', 'Us', 'You', 'His', and 'They'. The motivation for this stems from my belief that different catagorizations of pronouns can be used to determine the entire theme of the address, which may in turn tell us more about the enviroment at the time the address was given.

On a more technical note, I used a [pronoun type]/[total pronouns in address] model to determine the rates at which each pronoun types are used. The reasoning behind this, is that it allows for biases that may arise from factors like address length to be discounted, and allows for each address to be observed in a fairly isolated fashion.

# Summary
In closing, I feel that the graph created lends itself well to the purpose of analyzing trends in presidental addresses over time. On a quick glace, several interesting trends can be observed. Primarily, there is a large shift from the use of first person singular pronouns to first person plural pronouns. While the primary purpose of this project is not to provide an analysis on such changes, but rather to provide a medium through which such analysis can be done, a simple surface level analysis might claim that this represents a shift from a individualistic view of the presidential role, to one that panders more to the people and a nationalistic approach as time goes on. Aside from this, we can also observe other trends such as the shift in usage of third person singular pronouns over time, which may also lead to some interesting analysis.
